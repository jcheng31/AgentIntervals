AgentIntervals
==============

An interval-running timer for the [AGENT Smartwatch](http://www.agentwatches.com). Currently, AgentIntervals is hardcoded to repeat intervals of 10-20-30 seconds (inspired by [this](http://lifehacker.com/5915428/the-10+20+30-running-concept-can-increase-performance-in-less-time)), but in the future will allow user-customisable values (and possibly the traditional "short-long" type.)

## Roadmap
* User-adjustable interval timings
* Automatic breaks (with customisable duration)
* **(If Supported by SDK)** Vibrate the watch when interval elapses
* Switch between the current (fast, medium, slow) interval system and a normal (fast, slow) one
