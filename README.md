AgentIntervals
==============

An interval-running timer for the [AGENT Smartwatch](http://www.agentwatches.com). By default, AgentIntervals uses intervals of 30-20-10 seconds (inspired by [this](http://lifehacker.com/5915428/the-10+20+30-running-concept-can-increase-performance-in-less-time)), but also allows user-customisable values for each.

## TODO
* Automatic breaks (with customisable duration)
* **(When Supported by SDK)** Vibrate the watch when interval elapses
* Switch between the current (slow-medium-fast) interval system and a more traditional (slow-fast) one
